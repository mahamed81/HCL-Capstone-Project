Music Instrument Project:

This is a Music Instrument project where users can select music instruments which shows the details of the product including, price, and the condition. For each item, the user can view product, product detail, the price, as well as the condition of the product.
Also, once the customer chooses a product, they can add to the shopping cart and check out and pay for the product.

There is an admin page where the administrator can view, edit, and delete products. The admin can see all the users as well as add products to the product inventory.


Here is step by step how the application works.

At first, a user would register by providing basic information and their main or billing address.

After that, the user logins into the application.

An Admin can add products to the product inventory by filling the add product form.

The product then shows up in the product list. Where a user can see it and view it for detail

A user can view the product detail and add the product to their shopping cart or they can go back the product list.

After the user adds the product, they can see what’s in their shopping card, where they can remove any product they don’t like and continue shopping or they can check out if they are ready.

Since the user information is already in the system, the payment is processed right away and they are done with their shopping.

This is the admin page, where the admin can logout, go to the product inventory to add or delete products, and the customer management page where the admin can see all the users.

In the product inventory page, the admin can delete, add or update products.
